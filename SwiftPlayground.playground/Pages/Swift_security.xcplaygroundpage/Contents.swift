 **How familiar are you with the iOS security architecture and frameworks?**

 - iOS utilizes a layered security model to protect user data and maintain the integrity of the system. At the core of the security architecture is the Secure Enclave, a dedicated coprocessor responsible for handling sensitive operations such as encryption, biometric data, and key management. This ensures that even if the main processor is compromised, critical data remains secure.

 - In terms of frameworks, iOS offers several security-related frameworks that developers can utilize to enhance the security of their applications. Some of the key frameworks include:
    - Security.framework: This framework provides a wide range of cryptographic and security services such as encryption, hashing, digital certificates, and keychain access.
    - Keychain Services: The Keychain Services API allows secure storage and retrieval of sensitive information, such as passwords, encryption keys, and certificates.
    - LocalAuthentication.framework: This framework enables developers to implement biometric authentication, such as Touch ID or Face ID, to secure access to sensitive data within their applications.
 - Alongside these frameworks, iOS implements various security measures at the operating system level, including sandboxing, data encryption, code signing, secure boot chain, and app permissions. These measures collectively contribute to a robust security architecture on iOS devices.
