 - **Integration testing:** focuses on testing how different units or modules of your application interact and work together as a group. It verifies the interfaces and data flow between these integrated components.
 
    - **Scope:** Multiple integrated units or modules.
 
 - **Regression testing:** is the process of re-running existing tests (which can include unit tests, integration tests, and even UI tests) to ensure that recent code changes (e.g., bug fixes, new features, refactoring) have not introduced new bugs or caused existing, previously working functionalities to "regress" or break.
 
    - **Scope:** The entire application or significant parts of it, depending on the change. It covers both individual units and integrated systems.
 
 - **Unit testing:** focuses on testing the smallest individual components or "units" of your code in isolation. A "unit" typically refers to a single function, method, or class.
 
    - **Scope:** Individual functions, methods, or classes.
