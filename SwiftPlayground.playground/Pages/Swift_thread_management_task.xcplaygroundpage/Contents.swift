 ## Task
 
 - **Asynchronous Context:** A Task provides the environment where you can use await. If you have async functions you want to call from a synchronous context (like a button tap handler in UIKit or the main function of a command-line tool), you typically wrap them in a Task.
 - **Cooperative Thread Pool:** Tasks don't map directly to threads. Swift's concurrency runtime manages a pool of threads and cooperatively schedules tasks on them. When a task awaits, it suspends itself, and the thread can be used by another task. When the awaited operation completes, the task resumes.
 - **Cancellation:** Tasks are cancellable. You can call task.cancel() on a Task instance, and the task can periodically check Task.isCancelled or Task.checkCancellation() to react and stop its work gracefully.
 - **Result:** A Task can produce a result (await task.value) or throw an error.
 
 **Parent-Child Relationship (Structured Concurrency):**
 
 When you create a Task within an existing async function, it often becomes a child task. If the parent task is cancelled or finishes, its child tasks are automatically cancelled. This helps prevent "leaked" background work.
 Task.detached creates a detached task, which is an independent top-level task not tied to the lifecycle of its creation scope. Use these with caution, as their cancellation and error propagation are entirely separate.
 
 **When to use Task:**

 - To start an asynchronous operation from a synchronous context (e.g., kicking off a network request from a UI event).
 - To perform an independent piece of work that doesn't need to block the current execution flow.
 - To create a new, concurrent branch of execution.

// For a SwiftPM executable, @main struct MyApp { static func main() async { ... } } handles this.
