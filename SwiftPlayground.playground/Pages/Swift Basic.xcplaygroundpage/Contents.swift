 # Type Safety and Type Inference in Swift

 ## Type Safety
 - **Type Safety:** Swift is a type-safe language, ensuring you are clear about the types of values your code can work with.
 - **Error Prevention:** Swift performs type checks during compilation, flagging mismatched types as errors to catch and fix them early.
 
 ## Type Inference
 - **Automatic Type Deduction:** Swift uses type inference to deduce the type of a value based on the provided data, reducing the need for explicit type declarations.
 - **Literal Values:** When you assign a literal value to a constant or variable, Swift infers the type:
 ```
 let meaningOfLife = 42 // Inferred as Int
 let pi = 3.14159 // Inferred as Double
 ```
 - **Combining Literals:** When combining integer and floating-point literals, Swift infers the type based on context:
 ```
 let anotherPi = 3 + 0.14159 // Inferred as Double
 ```
